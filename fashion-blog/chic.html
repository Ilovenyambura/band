    <h1>Welcome to my fashion blog!</h1>

    <div class=important>
    <h4>My idea of fashion</h4>
    <p>To begin with,la mode is a french word that means fashion.</p>
    <p>For me fashion is about what looks good on a person.Designer names do not mean much if you watch fashion shows from Paris,Madrid etc etc if you'd be caught dead wearing the designer clothes.</p>
    <p>To be honest,I also wouldn't be caught dead wearing those designer clothes.</p>
    <p>I mean,they are either too scanty or too humongous.Just not clothes I'd enjoy wearing</p>
    <p>So just to clear the air,I'll only discuss clothes I am very comfortable seeing myself in.However,anyone with more ideas on clothes or jewellery i can discuss can message me</p>

    <div class=important>
    <h4>Chambray</h4>
    <p>I know most of you are wondering what piece of clothing a chambray is,but worry no more!A chambray is what we Kenyans commonly call a denim shirt.</p>
    <p>I have been in love with denim since the trend began way back when i was just a very young girl</p>
    <p>First,when buying a chambray please do not buy one with heavy fabric because it is ususally worn on top of clothe like crop tops,sleevless tops or [for the boys/men]as a shirt.</p>
    <p>I honestly think it's great when the weather seems mixed i.e when you are unsure about whether it is going to be sunny or rainy</p>
    <p>Also,I wouldn't advise anyone to buy a tight chambray.It is supposed to allow your skin to breathe not suffocate.</p>
    <p>Chambrays are not sold in blue only,for those who feel like blue denim is not their cup of tea.They are available in black,maroon,green.It just depends on the seller.</p>
    <p>To wrap it up,chambrays do not cost more than 800KES.Most are sold at Toy market,Gikomba market and Ngara</p>
